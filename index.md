## Biography
Since 2019, I have been a postdoctoral researcher in the research team of Prof. Gang Yan at the School of Physics Science and Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, China. I received my B.Sc. and Ph.D. degree at the University of Western Australia in 2013 and 2018 respectively. I was born in Rockingham, Western Australia, a city whose neighbouring islands host both penguins and sea lions.

Among other things, I am interested in complex systems, network science, nonlinear time series analysis, and Chinese culture.
