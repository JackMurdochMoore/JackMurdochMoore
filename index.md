## Biography
I am a postdoctoral researcher in the research team of Prof. Gang Yan at the School of Physics Science and Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, China. I received my B.Sc. and Ph.D. degree at the University of Western Australia in 2013 and 2018 respectively. I grew up in Rockingham, Western Australia, a city whose neighbouring islands host penguins and sea lions.

I am interested in complex systems, network science, nonlinear time series analysis, and Chinese culture. My Chinese name is 墨龙明 (Mò Lóngmíng), and I am usually called Jack or 小明 (Xiǎomíng).
